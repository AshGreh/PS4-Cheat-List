# Help Wanted

Maintaining the PS4 Cheat List alone is not an easy endeavor. Thus to make things easier for me, I am looking for someone to join me in maintaining this list on github.

## Requirements

* Must have joined [github](https://github.com/)

* Must know how to use [github](https://github.com/) (site), [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [git](https://git-scm.com/)

* Must know how to use a text editor like [atom](https://atom.io/) or [notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

* Must know how to use [Markdown](http://commonmark.org/) language

## What You Get

* Direct collaborator access to the [PS4 Cheat List](https://github.com/JDsnyke/PS4-Cheat-List) Github repo

## Your Role

* Peruse psxhax and the ps4 cheater discord (and other sites, if any) for the latest cheats / offsets at least once per day

* Contact authors for full details on title id, update version, firmware version and ps4cheater version

* Link original posts on github (reference links), codes, etc.

I will still update the repo of course, but limit my updates for a while. With my other real life obligations, going through the forums is a pain, trust me. Contact me by tagging me on psxhax (Shurikan117) or pm me on discord (Animated2Monkey#2949).
