In other news, I'm currently working on detailing the cheat list codes so that pointers and other info are directly reflected on the site instead of a measly, '0 ADDRESS' format. It's a work in progress, so bear with me!

Feel free to contact me by tagging @Animated2Monkey#2949 on Discord or ask around the PSXHAX forums.

Cheers!
